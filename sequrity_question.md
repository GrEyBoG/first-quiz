# System Security Audit for Solar Panel Installation App

## Introduction
As the head of Engineering for a solar panel installation app startup, we're conducting a security audit according to the OWASP Top 10 for 2021. Our infrastructure is deployed in Kubernetes containers on a cloud platform, encompassing a mobile app, a web frontend, a MySQL database, and a Python backend.

## Employee Roles and Access Levels

### 1. Broken Access Control
- **12 Software Engineers**: Full system access with specific duties assigned using role-based access control (RBAC) to limit overprivileged access.

### 2. Cryptographic Failures
- **Software Engineers**: Tasked with managing cryptographic keys and implementing SSL/TLS, ensuring the encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.

### 3. Injection
- **Software Engineers**: Responsible for securing the backend, particularly against SQL injection and other injection threats.

### 4. Insecure Design
- **Software Engineers**: Dedicated to maintaining secure design principles throughout the application's architecture.

### 5. Security Misconfiguration
- **Software Engineers**: In charge of system configurations, ensuring secure default settings and regular updates.

### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **Software Engineers**: Handle dependency management, including regular updates and patching of libraries and frameworks.

### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures
- **Software Engineers**: Oversee robust authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication and secure session management.

### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **Software Engineers**: Responsible for CI/CD processes, ensuring the integrity of software updates and data handling.

### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- **Software Engineers**: Monitor system logs and alerts to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Software Engineers**: Concentrate on server security, including appropriate firewall configurations to reduce SSRF risks.

## Detailed Employee Distribution

- The **12 Software Engineers** have specific roles, some of which intersect across different security domains, each with focused responsibilities to ensure full coverage.
- **3 Customer Support Employees**: Limited access to customer information for account management, no system configuration access.
- **1 Sales Employee**: Access restricted to customer contact information for sales purposes.

## Employee Focus and Multitasking

- **2 Software Engineers** are experts in encryption and key management.
- **2 Software Engineers** specialize in server security and firewall configurations.
- **3 Software Engineers** are focused on secure configurations and system maintenance.
- **3 Software Engineers** are dedicated to backend security against code injection.
- **2 Software Engineers** handle the CI/CD pipeline and data integrity.

Even though some engineers have specialized roles, while others cover multiple security areas, we implement cross-training and conduct regular internal audits to ensure coverage and capability for key positions.

## Non-Azure Specific Strategy
In an environment not specific to Azure, we would leverage a combination of open-source tools and best practices:

- Use of secure container orchestration tools like Kubernetes with proper network policies and pod security policies.
- Implementation of a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault for secure handling of secrets.
- Employing an automated security scanning tool like OWASP ZAP or SonarQube for continuous security assessment.
- Utilizing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) like ModSecurity to protect the web frontend.
- Setting up robust logging and monitoring using solutions like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a similar system.
- Incorporating secure CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI with security checks integrated.

By utilizing these tools and strategies, our team can secure our infrastructure in a cloud-agnostic manner, ensuring robust defense against common threats and alignment with security best practices.

## Conclusion
Whether using Azure-specific services or a more vendor-neutral stack, our approach to security is rooted in the OWASP Top 10 framework and adapted to our cloud environment. By combining our team's expertise with a suite of security tools, we are dedicated to maintaining a secure and resilient infrastructure.
